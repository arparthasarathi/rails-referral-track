This is a very simple app for referral and/or affiliate tracking in rails. I wanted to create a dropbox style referral options

The basic idea is that the devise user id is the referral code. When a user logs in, their referral code is in the header. When a new user signs up via that referral link, the referral id is stored. 

This app was built on top of the RailsApp with Devise, CanCan and Bootstrap pre-intalled.

I did a short blog write up as to how it was created - 

http://danvoell.com/dev/2013/06/simple-affiliate-and-referral-tracking-with-devise-in-rails-with-a-hint-of-cookies-and-session-variables/

I am a hack developer at best if you have ideas for improvements, by all means go for it, or let me know what I should do. 

Thanks!
Dan
